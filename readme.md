In the API the diffcult that I faced was trying to get marker for the hotels in each city and trying to get the heatwave maps to show when I ran the cell. The random city syntax did at times made it complicated to properly run the syntax however when I carefully worked each of the lessons in the moddule it explained the proper ways to run the code. The issues that I had with the heatwave was minor issue with installation of plugin's. With the help from a tutor I found plugins needed to properly run the heatwave map in the challenges. 
Each of the API's modules presented challenges in it's own right with easy fixes. What I learned from this is the proper understanding how to use latitude and longitude to create marks for various destination. Each cordinate can locate various destinations as well as accomdcations that company's utilze operations to reach it's customers easier.
